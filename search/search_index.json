The 3D media is created once and hosted on a server or on a local computer. Any XR device can display and interact with it remotely thanks to a dedicated UMI3D browser.</p> <p></p> <p>Creating experiences with UMI3D helps to reduce the number of experiences that should be developed to treat the same use case with different devices. Moreover, it enables different devices to interact within a same experience without any further development.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#how-does-it-work","title":"How does it work?","text":"<p>UMI3D relies on an interaction-based device abstraction layer. It allows remote 3D media created with the UMI3D SDK to describe its possible interactions with a finite and limited set of objects.</p> <p></p> <p>Each UMI3D browser supervises the loading/synchronization of 3D content, as well as the dynamic generation of an adapted to the device user interface, allowing its user to perform the described interactions. The main difference with existing cross-platform development standards such as WebVR or OpenXR is UMI3D's interaction-based device abstraction layer. These standards are limiting the designer to the usage of devices' common features. UMI3D enables to use all of the device's features to perform the interaction received.</p>"},{"location":"pages/about/license/","title":"UMI3D SDK License","text":"<p>Apache License</p> <p>Version 2.0, January 2004</p> <p>http://www.apache.org/licenses/</p> <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION</p> <ol> <li> <p>Definitions.</p> <p>\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.</p> <p>\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by   the copyright owner that is granting the License.</p> <p>\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common   control with that entity.
