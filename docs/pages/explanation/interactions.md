# Interaction model

The Interaction System enables user to interact with the 3D environment, enabling user changes in the environment.

## Model

The UMI3D interaction model  is divided into 5 key steps:

1. **Declaration**: The actions a user can process are declared dynamically in the environment.
    Those atomic interactions are called _interactions blocks_ and are grouped within _tools_.
    They are then sent to browsers.
2. **Selection**: When a _tool_ is selected by a user, the tool is _projected_ on the controller.
    This means that the interactions are then available with the adequate inputs on the controller.
    If a specific user interface is required, it is generated by the browser to handle the interaction.
3. **Interaction**: When interactions are performed with projected tools, browsers send different _Interaction Requests_ to notify the environment about the current user's actions.
4. **Reaction**: Receiving the request announcing the activation of an interaction block, the environment triggers feedbacks as a reaction.
    This enables the alteration of the environment through a _Manipulation_, the set up of a _Parameter_, the answer to a _Form_, or the triggering of an _Event_.
5. **Retroaction**: Finally, the reaction may change the available interactions for the users.

The complete list of supported Parameters and Interaction Requests can be found in the API reference.
