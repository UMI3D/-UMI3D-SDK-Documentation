## Pre-interaction feedback

While hovering `Interactable` entities, hover feedback is sent back to the server if the `notifyOnHover` parameter is On.

## Post-interaction feedback

While an interaction is performed, interactions _Requests_ are sent to the environment for triggering feedbacks as reactions and possibly change the available interactions. This behaviors could be totally customized thorugh the right UMI3D events, parameters and custom scripts during the environment design.
